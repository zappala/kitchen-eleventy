My mom has always made this chocolate chip cake for our birthdays and
holidays. It is so good, and we’ve never seen anyone else make it, so
we took to calling it her "secret" recipe. Thankfully, she shared it
with us and other family members so that we can pass on this amazing
tradition. Thanks, mom!

## Batter

Blend:

* 1 cube butter, softened
* 1 cup sugar

Beat in

* 2 eggs

Mix together in a separate bowl:

* 2 cups flour
* 1/2 teaspoons salt
* 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
* 1 teaspoon baking powder

Alternately add the dry ingredients and:

* 1 cup sour cream

## Cake Assembly

Mix together:

* 1/4 cup sugar
* 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon

Spray an angel food cake pan. Alternately add to the pan:

* 1/2 cake batter
* 1/2 bag chocolate chips
* 1/2 cinnamon/sugar mixture
* rest of batter
* rest of chocolate chips
* rest of cinnamon/sugar mixture

You’ll need to spread the batter with a spatula, because it is
thick. It will look like you don’t have enough batter, but be patient.

Bake at 325° for 40 – 45 minutes. Let cool before eating.
